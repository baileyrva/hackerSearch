# Hacker News
This repository ("Hacker News") is an application that gives users the ability to search a tech centered news source Hacker News. The user can search within the search bar, and can search for previous searched items by clicking a button that is automatically generated. 


## Installation

The application is deployed using github. The main page can be opened in the browser by using local host and **yarn run start** from the terminal. Please make sure that all dependencies are installed (**yarn install**) before running main application. As a first time user you will make their first search which will then be saved under the Previous column. The results will be displayed under the Results column until the user creates a different search.

This application was built by me Joe Bailey. YouTube, provided websites, and friends with more experience were the main resources. This was the first time learning Redux, so I leaned on previous code, stack-overflow, and documentation to help me out of problematic areas.
